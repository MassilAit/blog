    Content: "This is still an early version of the blog, but for now Iâ€™ll mainly post about computer science and electrical engineering concepts I find interesting. Iâ€™ll try to post every few weeks. The technical depth of each post will vary; some will be beginner-friendly, while others may focus on more advanced topics. I created this blog to share the cool ideas I come across during my studies. Enjoy the read!"
